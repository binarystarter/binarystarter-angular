# Angular, Payload CMS, ExpressJs - Free Open-Source Boilerplate

**✨ Enterprise Level Web Application Development Starter without the complexity.**

Secure, Stable, Automated.

## Integrated and Ready to Use Angular Material and TailwindCSS

There’s no relationship without any compromises. It’s available in both real life and between Tailwind CSS and Angular Materials.

Although you cannot modify angular material components using Tailwind CSS, you can use it everywhere else!

Tailwind CSS and Angular Material both come out of the box, preconfigured and ready to be used. 

## Authentication and Authorization

The authentication system is based on Passport Js.

Out of the box you get the following pages in Angular, connected with the ExpressJs and Payload CMS.

## Angular SSR and Dashboard App

Angular comes with separated modules for the static pages and the single page application.

Separation of concerns is very important at this stage of development of the Angular Universal.

Static Pages are encapsuled in their modules and they don’t interact with browser APIs hungry components.

## DRY - Shared Types between the Backend and Frontend

The Backend TypeScript types should not be available on the Frontend.

What most developers do is create the same types on both frontend and backend APIs, which makes a bad precedence of duplicated code.

This problem is solved by using a mono repository.

Managed by nx.dev tools - now extending TypeScript types from the Backend or creating them from scratch can be done in a single shared library between your Angular app and ExpressJs Backend.

## ExpressJs Server integrated with Payload CMS out of the box

We get all the benefits of a monorepository out of the box.

ExpressJs is tightly integrated with PayloadCMS, but you can still add your own routes, outside of Payload.

We believe in TypeScript, hence everything is based on TypeScript.
